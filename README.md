# Refact-Seo
* Welcome to HoriSEOon, your go-to digital marketing solutions provider. As a bootcamp student, I have improved the codebase for long-term sustainability, ensuring that it meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

Why Choose HoriSEOon?
* Enhanced Accessibility: The codebase prioritizes accessibility, ensuring that all users, regardless of abilities, can easily navigate and understand the content.

* Optimized for Search Engines: We understand the importance of search engine optimization (SEO). The codebase is structured to enhance visibility and ranking on search engines.

* Efficient CSS: The CSS has been reworked for efficiency by consolidating selectors and properties. It follows a semantic structure, aligning with HTML elements, and includes comments for better organization.

# User Story
As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

# Acceptance Criteria
* Semantic HTML Elements: When you view the source code, you will find semantic HTML elements used to structure the content of the webpage.

* Logical Structure:When you view the structure of the HTML elements, you will find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The hierarchy of elements is organized to enhance understanding.

* Accessible Alt Attributes:When you view the image elements, you will find that each image has an accessible alt attribute. This ensures that users with visual impairments can understand the content conveyed by the images.

* Sequential Heading Attributes:When you view the heading attributes, you will find that they fall in sequential order (h1, h2, h3, etc.). This helps in maintaining a clear and structured hierarchy for better user experience and search engine optimization.

* Concise, Descriptive Title: When you view the title element in the HTML head, you will find a concise and descriptive title ("HoriSEOon - Enhanced Digital Marketing Solutions"). The title accurately represents the content and purpose of the webpage.
